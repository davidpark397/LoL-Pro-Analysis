# LoL-Pro-Analysis
The 2019 League of Legends World Championship (Worlds 2019) has sparked discussion on the skill level and effectiveness of certain players. There is relative disagreement among casual fans, analysts, and even the professional players themselves on how "good" the competitors are. 

One interesting element of this discussion is player "uniqueness". Doinb, the mid laner for the newly crowned world champion team FunPlus Phoenix, for example, is thought of to be a skilled player in a unique way due to the fact that he affects the game by roaming and not through superior laning such as other mid lane superstars like former world champions Faker or Rookie.

Uniqueness is something that is difficult to quantify - how do we first define player uniqueness and how do we best capture what we're talking about? Here, I'm attempting to develop a uniqueness index by measuring the distance of a player's stats from the average stats of other players across regions and roles in order to add to this discussion.

The data that I will be using for this set of analyses was scraped from https://gol.gg/esports/, which contains different statistics such as win rate, KDA, CSM, Avg WPM, etc. for players from all professional leagues.
